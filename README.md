# PacMan Movement Project
Name: Pac man movement activity, MIT x Pro course assignment ðŸ‘¾

Description: Move pac man across the screen forwards and backwards, chomping as he moves

How to run: Click and watch Pac-Man move! Each click advances Pac-Man one step. You must click on Pac-Man himself for him to advance. 
Visit my website, nmc1313.github.io for a direct link to the project!

Support: W3 docs, JavaScipt tutor

Future Improvements: Add more movements and stop/start button for pacman to move continuously. Have Pac-Man change direction at screen edge.
